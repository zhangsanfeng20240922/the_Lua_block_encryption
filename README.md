# the_Lua_block_encryption
encrypt lua by block

use:
// ssss is your encryption key, and your virtual machine must have the same key to execute. Similarly, in order to dump Lua source code, reverse engineers must first find the encoding method and then know the key
luac -key ssss test.lua

and , I will release the corresponding code for executing the virtual machine later
